Files included:

How to host on GitHub Pages (quick steps):
1. Create a new repository on https://github.com with a name you like (e.g., birthday).
2. Upload all files from this ZIP to the repository (Upload files -> choose files -> Commit).
3. In the repo, go to Settings -> Pages.
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch", choose "main" branch and folder "/" then Save.
5. Wait a minute; your site will be at:
   https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
6. To personalize the name in the page, append: ?name=Garima
   Example: https://prashantvyas.github.io/birthday/?name=Garima

Notes:
- Background music uses an external mp3 URL. If you prefer to include your own mp3, replace the audio src in index.html with the mp3 file path and upload it to the repo.
- If autoplay is blocked on some browsers, tap/click once on the page to start music.
